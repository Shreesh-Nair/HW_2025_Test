Doofus Adventure Game

Submission by Shreesh R Nair — 22BAI1120

Overview

Doofus Adventure is a simple skill-based platformer where the player controls a small cube (“Doofus”) and tries to move across disappearing pulpits (platforms).
The goal is to survive as long as possible and score points by reaching new pulpits before they vanish.
Each pulpit has a limited lifetime and disappears after its countdown reaches zero.

Gameplay

The player starts on a pulpit at the center of the map.

Adjacent pulpits spawn based on timing rules and disappear after a few seconds.

Each pulpit shows a countdown timer so the player can judge when it will vanish.

Reaching a new pulpit increases the score by +1.

Falling off results in a Game Over screen.
