#Overview

Doofus Adventure is a simple skill-based platformer where the player controls a small cube (“Doofus”) and tries to move across disappearing pulpits (platforms).
The goal is to survive as long as possible and score points by successfully reaching new pulpits before they vanish.

The game becomes challenging because each pulpit has a limited lifetime and disappears after a countdown.

#Gameplay
-The player starts on a pulpit at the center of the map.

-Adjacent pulpits spawn based on timing rules and disappear after a few seconds.

-Each pulpit shows a countdown timer on its surface so the player knows how long it will stay.

-When the player moves onto a new pulpit, the score increases by 1.

-If the player falls off the platforms, the game ends and moves to the Game Over screen.
