##  Overview  
**Doofus Adventure** is a simple skill-based platformer where the player controls a small cube (“Doofus”) and moves across disappearing pulpits (platforms).  
The goal is to **survive as long as possible** and **score points** by reaching new pulpits before they vanish.  
Each pulpit has a limited lifetime and disappears after its countdown reaches zero.

---

##  Gameplay  

- The player starts on a pulpit at the center of the map.  
- Adjacent pulpits spawn based on timing rules and disappear after a few seconds.  
- Each pulpit shows a countdown timer so the player can judge when it will vanish.  
- Reaching a new pulpit increases the score by **+1**.  
- Falling off results in a **Game Over** screen.
